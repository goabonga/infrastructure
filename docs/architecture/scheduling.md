# Scheduling

Compute instances are placed onto nodes by the **scheduler**, a cluster-level
controller in `infra-controller-manager`. It runs under leader election, so a
single instance is active across the cluster.

## Nodes and pools

- A **node** registers a host with the control plane along with its schedulable
  `capacity` (CPUs, memory, max pods) and `labels`.
- A **node pool** groups nodes by a label `nodeSelector` and reports how many
  members are ready.

## Liveness

A node is schedulable only while it is **recently seen**. The agent stamps its
node's `status.lastSeen` each pass (see [node-scoped realization](#node-scoped-realization)),
and the scheduler marks a node `Ready` only when that heartbeat is within its
ready window (four reconcile intervals). A node that has never heartbeated, or
whose heartbeat is stale, is marked `Pending` and excluded from placement; the
node pool's ready count tracks only live nodes.

When a node goes stale or is deleted, the scheduler **evicts** the compute placed
on it - clearing `status.nodeName` so it is rescheduled onto a live node the same
pass. (A still-running but unreachable node's workload is not stopped; eviction
only re-places the record.)

## Placement

Each reconcile pass the scheduler:

1. Recomputes every node's allocation from the compute already assigned to it
   (CPU, memory and pod counts), so allocation never drifts.
2. Derives each node's readiness from its heartbeat.
3. For each unscheduled compute (`status.nodeName` empty), selects the
   least-loaded **ready** node that
   - matches the compute's node pool selector (when `nodePoolId` is set), and
   - has free CPU, memory and pod capacity for the request.
4. Writes the chosen node to the compute's `status.nodeName`, and records the
   node's `status.allocated`/readiness and the pool's ready/total counts.

A compute that fits no node is left unscheduled and retried on the next pass.
Placement is written to the latest copy of the compute, so the agent's status
fields are preserved.

```
compute (nodePoolId?) ----> scheduler ----> status.nodeName = node-x
node-x.status.allocated += {cpu, memory, 1 pod}
```

## Node-scoped realization

The agent realizes compute only where it was placed. Set `GOA_NODE_ID` on
`infra-agent` to the node's id and the agent both heartbeats that node and
reconciles only the compute whose `status.nodeName` matches; everything else is
left to the node that owns it.

With `GOA_NODE_ID` unset the agent realizes every compute, which is the
single-host development default.
