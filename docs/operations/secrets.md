# Secrets and PKI

The control plane stores secret material encrypted at rest. Every private value
is sealed with the key-encryption key (KEK) before it is written and is only
recoverable through an explicit reveal call.

## Enabling encryption

The secret and PKI routes are served only when the API has a KEK. Provide it as
a base64-encoded 32-byte key in `GOA_KMS_KEY`:

```bash
GOA_KMS_KEY="$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)" infra-api
```

Without `GOA_KMS_KEY` the API logs `secret routes disabled` and the
`/secret`, `/secret_version`, `/ssl_ca` and `/ssl_cert` endpoints are absent.

## Secrets

A secret holds an opaque value encrypted with the KEK. Writes take the
plaintext; reads never return it. Plaintext is recoverable only through the
dedicated reveal endpoint.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/secret/{uid}` | Store (encrypt) a value. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/secret` | List secrets (redacted). |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/secret/{uid}` | Get a secret (redacted). |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/secret/{uid}/reveal` | Decrypt and return the value. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/secret/{uid}` | Delete a secret. |

### Versions

A `secret_version` is an immutable, separately encrypted snapshot of a secret's
data, numbered sequentially per secret. Versions let you keep history or stage a
rotation before promoting it.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/secret_version/{uid}` | Store a new version (body: `secretId`, `data`). |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/secret_version?secretId=...` | List versions of a secret. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/secret_version/{uid}/reveal` | Decrypt and return a version. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/secret_version/{uid}` | Delete a version. |

The assigned version number is reported in `status.version`.

## PKI

A certificate authority (`ssl_ca`) holds a self-signed CA whose private key is
KEK-encrypted; its public certificate is served in clear. A CA can sign leaf
certificates two ways:

- **Ephemeral** - `POST /api/v1/ssl_ca/{uid}/issue` returns a fresh certificate
  and key without storing them.
- **Persisted** - an `ssl_cert` is signed by a CA and stored, with its private
  key encrypted at rest and recoverable through reveal. A certificate can cover
  DNS names and IP addresses.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/ssl_ca/{uid}` | Create a CA. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/ssl_ca/{uid}/issue` | Issue an ephemeral leaf certificate. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/ssl_cert/{uid}` | Sign and store a leaf (body: `caId`, `commonName`, `dnsNames`, `ipAddresses`). |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/ssl_cert/{uid}/reveal` | Return the certificate and decrypted key. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/ssl_cert/{uid}` | Delete a certificate. |

Private keys (CA and leaf) never appear in list or get responses and are never
written to disk in clear; reveal is the only path that decrypts them.
