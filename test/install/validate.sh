# Validate an installed infra Debian package.
#
# Run against a .deb that has already been installed with dpkg/apt, on a host
# with systemd running as PID 1. This is the check that the .deb is not merely
# well-formed - lintian covers that - but actually usable: the binary loads,
# the unit parses, the service reaches a listening state, and the hardening
# directives in the unit do not stop it from starting.
#
# That last point is why this exists. Every protection added to a unit is a
# way to make the daemon fail to start, and `systemd-analyze security` scores
# a unit without ever running it. Only starting the service proves that the
# syscall filter, the capability bounding set and the namespace restrictions
# left the daemon room to work.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo test/install/validate.sh <package>
