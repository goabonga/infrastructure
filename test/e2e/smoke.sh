# End-to-end smoke suite against a running control plane.
#
# Expects the four listening components reachable on localhost - the CI
# `e2e-stack` action deploys the Helm chart onto kind and port-forwards them.
# Nothing here knows it is running under Kubernetes: point the env vars at any
# deployment and it works.
#
# What this covers that the unit and integration suites cannot: the resource
# round-trip crosses a real HTTP boundary into a container running as a
# non-root user with a read-only root filesystem, against PostgreSQL rather
# than the file store, with the dashboard proxying to the API over a Service.
# Every one of those is a way for a change that passes `go test` to be broken
# in the deployment that ships.
