state directory or, for high availability, by PostgreSQL."

each host: network namespaces, nftables rules, cgroups v2, dm-crypt volumes
and OCI containers. Requires root and CAP_NET_ADMIN."

and spread schedulers under leader election."
  [terraform-provider-infra]="Manages infra resources from Terraform. Install
under the Terraform plugin directory rather than invoking it directly."
  [infra-exporter]="Exposes cluster resource counts and reconciliation state
as Prometheus metrics on /metrics."
  [infra-idp]="Issues short-lived ES256 JWTs and publishes the matching JWKS
for the control-plane API to verify."
  [infra-container-init]="Minimal init process for containers the agent
starts: reaps zombies and forwards signals to the workload."
